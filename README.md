# Eventual Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

This repository contains examples of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA) and Domain Driven Design (DDD) patterns implemented using [eventual](https://github.com/functionless/eventual) - a cloud framework designed for building massively scalable distributed systems.

It is inspired by the amazing [Serverless Land Event-Driven-Architecture (EDA) Visuals](https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/visuals) created by [David Boyne](https://twitter.com/boyney123).
